    \title Connecting Bare Metal Devices

    You can connect bare metal devices to a development host to run and debug
    applications on them from \QC using GDB or a hardware debugger. This enables
    you to debug on small devices that are not supported by the generic remote
    Linux device plugin. However, if the device does not have Qt libraries, you
    need a fake Qt installation.

    The bare metal device type accepts custom GDB commands that you specify in
    the device options.

    To connect bare metal devices:

    \list 1

        \li Select \gui Help > \gui {About Plugins} > \gui {Device Support} >
            \gui {Bare Metal} to enable the Bare Metal Device plugin.

        \li Restart \QC to be able to use the plugin.

        \li Select \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui Devices > \gui Add >
            \gui {Bare Metal Device} > \gui {Start Wizard}.

        \li In the \gui {GDB host} and \gui {GDB port} fields, specify the host
            name and port number to access the GDB server or hardware debugger.

        \li In the \gui {GDB commands} fields, specify custom commands for the
            GDB server or hardware debugger.

        \li To specify build settings:

        \list 1

            \li Open a project for an application you want to develop for the
                device.

            \li Select \gui Projects > \gui {Build & Run} > \gui {Add Kit} to
                add a kit for building and running applications on bare metal
                devices.

        \endlist

        \li Select \gui Run to specify run settings.

            Usually, you can use the default settings.

    \endlist
