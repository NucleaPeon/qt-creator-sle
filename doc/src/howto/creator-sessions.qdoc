    \title Managing Sessions

    When you exit \QC, a snapshot of your current workspace is stored as a
    \e session. To restore the session automatically when you start \QC,
    select \gui {File > Session Manager > Restore last session on startup}.

    When you open or create any of the following items, they automatically
    become a part of the session:

    \list

        \li Projects with their dependencies (including SUBDIRS projects)

        \li Editors

        \li Breakpoints and expressions

        \li Bookmarks

    \endlist

    A session is  personal, that is, not meant to be shared. It is not supposed
    to reflect the project structure. It contains personal data, such as
    bookmarks and breakpoints that are usually not of interest to other
    developers working on the same projects.

    For example, if you work on a project and need to switch to another project
    for a while, you can save your workspace as a session and then close the
    project and all the files in it. Everything that you open after saving the
    session becomes a part of a new session. When you want to return to working
    on the first project, open the saved session. \QC opens the projects and
    files that belong to the session.

    To create a new session or remove existing sessions, select \gui File >
    \gui{Session Manager}.

    To switch between sessions, choose \gui {File > Session Manager}. If you do
    not create or select a session, \QC always uses the default session, which
    was created the last time you exited \QC.

    When you launch \QC, a list of existing sessions is displayed in the
    \gui Welcome mode.

    When you start \QC from the command line, you can give the name of
    a session as argument and \QC will start with this session.
