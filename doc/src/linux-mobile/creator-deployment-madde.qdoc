    \title Deploying Applications to Embedded Linux Devices

    You can specify settings for deploying applications to generic Linux devices
    in the project .pro file.
    You can view the settings in the
    \gui {Run Settings}.

    \image qtcreator-maemo-deployment.png "Deploy to device"

    The files to be installed are listed in the \gui {Deployment} step,
    the \gui {Files to install for subproject} field. The \gui {Local File Path}
    field displays the location of the file on the development PC. The
    \gui {Remote Directory} field displays the folder where the file is
    installed on the device. Text in red color indicates that the information is
    missing. Edit the qmake \l{Variables#installs}
    {INSTALLS variable} in the project .pro file to add the missing files.

    When you run the application, \QC copies the necessary files to the device
    and starts the application on it.

    For example, adding

    \code
      target.path = /root
      INSTALLS += target
    \endcode

    to the project .pro file will copy the binary of your project to \c /root
    on the remote device. Additional files can be deployed by adding them to
    further targets and adding those to \c INSTALLS as well.

    \section1 Deploying on Embedded Linux

    \image qtcreator-embedded-linux-deployment.png "Deploy to embedded Linux"

    When you run the application on the \gui {Embedded Linux} device,
    \QC deploys the application as specified by the deploy steps. By default,
    \QC copies the application files to the device by using the SSH file
    transfer protocol (SFTP), as specified by the \gui {Upload files via SFTP}
    step.

    If you have a lot of data to copy, select \gui Details in the
    \gui {Upload Files via SFTP} step, and then select the
    \gui {Incremental deployment} check box. \QC takes note of the deployment
    time and only copies files that have changed since the last deployment.
    However, when you make major changes on the device, such as removing files
    from the device manually or flashing a new disk image, or when you use
    another device with the same IP address, deselect the check box once, to
    have \QC deploy all files again.

    To only create a tarball and not copy the files to the device, select
    \gui {Add Deploy Step > Create tarball}. Then remove all other deploy steps.

    The \gui {Deploy tarball via SFTP upload} step specifies that \QC
    uploads the tarball to the device and extracts it.

    \note If the SFTP upload fails, make sure that the remote device has
    SFTP enabled in its SSH daemon. Some versions of Dropbear that come
    without SFTP support will crash when an SFTP upload is being attempted.
    This is not a bug in \QC.
