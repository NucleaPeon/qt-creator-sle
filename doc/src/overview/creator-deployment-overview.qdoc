    \title Deploying to Mobile Devices

    Deploy configurations in the \gui Project mode \gui {Run Settings} handle
    the packaging of the application as an executable and copying it to a
    location you want to run the executable at. The files can be copied to a
    location in the file system of the development PC or a mobile device.

    \list

        \li \l{Deploying Applications to Android Devices}

            When you deploy the application to an Android device, \QC copies
            the application files to the device. In addition, you can determine
            the Qt libraries to use.
        \li  \l{Deploying Applications to BlackBerry 10 Devices}

            When you deploy the application to a BlackBerry 10 device, \QC generates a
            BAR package in the build directory and deploys it to the connected
            device.
        \li \l{Deploying Applications to Embedded Linux Devices}

            When you deploy the application to a generic Linux-based device, \QC
            copies the application files to the connected device. You
            can test and debug the application on the device.
        \li  \l{Deploying Applications to QNX Neutrino Devices}

            When you deploy the application to a BlackBerry, \QC  generates a
            BAR package in the build directory and deploys it to the connected
            device. When you deploy it to a QNX Neutrino device, \QC copies
            the application files to the connected device. You can test and
            debug the application on the device.
