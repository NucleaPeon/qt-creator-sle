    \title Supported Platforms

    You can install and run \QC on several operating systems to create
    applications for multiple desktop and mobile device platforms.

    \section1 Development Platforms

    \QC is available in binary packages for the following operating systems:

    \list

        \li Windows

        \list

            \li Windows Vista

            \li Windows 7

            \li Windows 8

            \li Windows 8.1

        \endlist

        \note Some \QC plugins rely on Direct3D (part of DirectX). You might
        have to manually enable support for it if you are running Windows in a
        Virtual Machine. For more information, see
        \l{http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#guestadd-3d}
        {Hardware 3D acceleration (OpenGL and Direct3D 8/9)} and
        \l{http://pubs.vmware.com/workstation-10/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.ws.using.doc%2FGUID-EA588485-718A-4FD8-81F5-B6E1F04C5788.html}
        {Prepare the Host System to Use DirectX 9 Accelerated Graphics}.

        \li (K)Ubuntu Linux 11.10 (32-bit and 64-bit) or later

        To build Qt applications using \QC on Linux, you usually need the
