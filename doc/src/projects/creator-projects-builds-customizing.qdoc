    \title  Customizing the Build Process

    To specify the relationship between the release, build,
    and deploy configurations, select \gui Tools > \gui Options > \gui {Build & Run}. By
    default, the \gui {Always build project before deploying it} and the
    \gui {Always deploy project before running it} options are enabled.
    Therefore, when you select the \gui Run function, \QC checks for changes in
    the project files and also builds and deploys the project if necessary.
