    \section2 Specifying Run Settings for QNX Devices

    To run and debug an application on a QNX or BlackBerry device, you must
    create connections from the development PC to the device. Click
    \gui {Manage device configurations} to create a connection. For more
    information, see \l{Connecting QNX Devices}.

    Specifying run settings for QNX Neutrino devices is very similar to
    \l{Specifying Run Settings for Linux-Based Devices}.

    \section2 Specifying Run Settings for Blackberry 10 Devices

    When you run the application on the BlackBerry 10 device, \QC first creates a BAR package
    using the settings in the Application Descriptor File. The default is to create the
    BAR package in the build directory. The BAR package is then deployed to the
    selected device. For more information, see \l{Deploying Applications to BlackBerry 10 Devices}.
