    \title Creating Qt Quick Projects

    \image qmldesigner-new-project.png "New File or Project dialog"

    When you create a new Qt Quick project from scratch, you have the following
    options:

    \list

        \li \gui {Qt Quick Application} creates a Qt Quick application project
            that can contain both QML and C++ code. The project includes a
            QDeclarativeView or QQuickView. You can build the application and
            deploy it to
            desktop and mobile target platforms.

        \li \gui {Qt Quick UI} creates a Qt Quick UI project with a single QML
            file that contains the main view. You can review Qt Quick UI
            projects in a \l{Previewing QML Files}{preview tool} and you need
            not build them. You do not
            need to have the development environment installed on your
            computer to create and run this type of project.

        \li \gui {Qt Quick Extension Plugins} (in the \gui Libraries category)
            create C++ plugins that make it possible to offer extensions that
            can be loaded dynamically into Qt Quick applications. Select
            \gui {Qt Quick 1 Extension Plugin} to create extensions for
            Qt Quick 1 applications and \gui {Qt Quick 2 Extension Plugin} to
            create extensions for Qt Quick 2 applications.

    \endlist

    \section1 Creating Qt Quick UI Projects

    \list 1

        \li Select \gui File > \gui {New File or Project} > \gui Applications >
            \gui {Qt Quick UI} > \gui Choose.

        \li In the \gui {Qt Quick component set} field, select the component set
            to use for the project. The Qt Quick imports enable you to create
            cross-platform applications with a custom look and feel, whereas the
            Qt Quick Controls provide the look and feel for a particular
            platform:

        \list

            \li Select \gui {Qt Quick Controls 1.1} or \gui {Qt Quick 2.2} to
                develop for platforms that run Qt 5.

            \li Select \gui {Qt Quick 1.1} to develop for platforms that run
                Qt 4.7.4. To develop for platforms that run Qt 4.7.1, 4.7.2, or
                4.7.3, you must change the import statement to import Qt Quick
                1.0.

        \endlist

    \endlist

    \QC creates the following files:

    \list

        \li .qmlproject project file defines that all QML, JavaScript, and image
            files in the project folder belong to the project. Therefore, you do
            not need to individually list all the files in the project.

        \li .qml file defines an UI item, such as a component, screen, or the
            whole application UI.

    \endlist

    To use JavaScript and image files in the application, copy them to the
    project folder.

    \section1 Creating Qt Quick Applications

    \list 1

        \li Select \gui File > \gui {New File or Project} > \gui Applications >
            \gui {Qt Quick Application} > \gui Choose.

        \li In the \gui {Qt Quick component set} field, select the component set
            to use for the project. For more information, see
            \l{Creating Qt Quick UI Projects}.

        \li Select \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kits} for running and building
            your project, and then click \gui{Next}.

            \note Kits are listed if they have been specified in \gui Tools >
            \gui Options > \gui {Build & Run} > \gui Kits.

        \li Review the project settings, and click \gui{Finish} (on Windows and
            Linux) or \gui Done (on Mac OS) to create the project.

    \endlist

    \note The SDK for a particular target platform might install additional
    templates for that platform. For example, the BlackBerry 10 and QNX templates are installed
    as part of the BlackBerry 10 NDK, BlackBerry NDK, or QNX SDK.

    \QC creates the necessary boilerplate files. Some of the files are
    specific to a particular target platform.
