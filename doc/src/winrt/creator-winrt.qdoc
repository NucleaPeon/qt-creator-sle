    \title Connecting Windows Runtime Devices

    You can build Windows Store Apps and run them on Windows Phones, Windows
    Phone Emulator, or the Windows computer in Modern UI mode.

    \QC uses the integrated \c windeployqt and \c winrtrunner tools to deploy
    and run applications. You can also run the tools manually from the command
    line.

    The Qt 5.3 installer adds Windows Runtime and Windows Phone Qt versions to
    \QC and creates the necessary kits.

    To connect Windows Runtime devices:

    \list 1

        \li Select \gui Help > \gui {About Plugins} > \gui {Device Support} >
            \gui WinRT to enable the experimental Winows Runtime plugin.

        \li Restart \QC to be able to use the plugin.

        \li To specify build settings:

        \list 1

            \li Open a project for an application you want to develop for the
                device.

            \li Select \gui Projects > \gui {Build & Run} > \gui {Add Kit} to
                add a kit for building and running applications on Windows
                Runtime devices (the local computer, for now) Windows Phones,
                or the Windows Phone emulator.

        \endlist

        \li Select \gui Run to specify run settings.

            Usually, you can use the default settings.
