    \class ProjectExplorer::IPublishingWizardFactory

    \brief The IPublishingWizardFactory class provides an interface for creating
    wizards to publish a project.

    A class implementing this interface is used to create an associated wizard
    that allows users to publish their project to a remote facility, such as an
    app store.

    Such a wizard would typically transform the project content into a format
    expected by that facility (\e packaging) and also upload it, if possible.

    The factory objects have to be added to the global object pool via
    \c ExtensionSystem::PluginManager::addObject().

    \sa ExtensionSystem::PluginManager::addObject()
*/

/*!
    \fn virtual QString displayName() const = 0

*/

 /*!
   \fn virtual QString description() const = 0

*/

/*!
    \fn virtual bool canCreateWizard(const Project *project) const = 0

/*!
    \fn virtual QWizard *createWizard(const Project *project) const = 0
